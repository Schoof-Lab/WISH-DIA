# Enhancing single-cell proteomics through tailored Data-Independent Acquisition and micropillar array-based chromatography

This repository contains all the custom code used for the manuscript 

The data required to run the code can be downloaded from these repositories: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7433298 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8146605. The .zip file should be extracted in the main directory.

The analysis is carried out the the form of R (.Rmd) and Python (.ipynb) notebooks. The notebooks are associated with the following main figures: <br />
    - Figure 1  "summary.Rmd", "window_ppp.Rmd" <br />
    - Figure 2  "summary.Rmd", "hrms1_precision.Rmd", hrms1_window_precision.Rmd","hrms1_SILAC.Rmd" <br />
    - Figure 3  "summary2.Rmd", "scMethod_precision.Rmd" <br />
    - Figure 4  "HLvsGPF.Rmd" <br />
    - Figure 5  "scProcessing.ipynb", "scVisualization.Rmd" <br />
    - Figure 6 and 7  "scDataset_direct.ipynb" (needs to be run first to generate the output for mesc_DE.Rmd), "mesc_DE.Rmd" <br />

The raw data for the manuscript can be found under the following massIVE identifier: MSV000090792 and MSV000092429.
